And with a new or difficult material, it might be worth using the printer's LCD menu (if present) or control software to manually extrude some filament before even trying to run a part file at all.  On some printers you have to do this by commanding it to heat the nozzle and then finding the menu where you can move the extruder (or it is geared, disables the steppers and turn it by hand).  On others, there's a move filament or manual extrude setting that achieves temperature and movement together." CreationDate="2016-04-17T19:14:21.900" UserId="1378" />

More in general, over-extrusion is typically only a problem on bottom and top layers and if you print with 100% infill, otherwise a typical print (2-4 layers of shell + infill &lt; 100%) won't be affected much, as the excess plastic will simply be pushed around slightly.

The only difference, and it *could* be considered significant, is that in [the other question](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6016/delta-printer-nozzle-not-moving-square-with-a-perfectly-level-bed-as-if-the-bed), the user *definitely* had a convex bed, whereas here, no configuration has been performed *at all*, and the form of the bed (which could be convex, concave or totally flat) is totally irrelevant in this case - as it currently stands."
